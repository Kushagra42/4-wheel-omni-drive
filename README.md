# The task was to create two robots which have the ability to play badminton with the robots of opponents team. Whichever team managed to win two out of three sets 
# would win the match.

# OMNI Wheels- As the name suggests, assist the robot to move in any direction when placed at an angle of 45 degrees tilt.  

# This folder contains the code for a four wheel omni wheel drive robot, which was written for the ABU ROBOCON 1014 competition (ROBOMINTON). 

# This code was implemted in Arduino Mega during the final run, snippets of the code were tested on AVR controllers(During the trial phase).

# Motion of the robot was controlled using a PS2 Controller.

# Analog values of PS2 and instruvtions were printed on an 16X2 LCD.
